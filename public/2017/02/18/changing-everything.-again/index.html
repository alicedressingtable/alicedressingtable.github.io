                <p>After 7 years spent in France I am officially moving to Tokyo, Japan, end of May 2017.
I am finally going to join my wife, Sarah, after almost 5 years of long and hard distant relationship.</p>

<p>Now, before to start with the burocracy madness and to move/sell/close/sign things, I am sitting here at home, in the first weekend after having resigned from my current company, trying to think about how many things I learned over the last 7 years. How many things I&rsquo;m going to bring with me from this French experience.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s strange to say, but the first thing that comes to my mind is my current employer, <strong>Amadeus</strong>. I would have never thought that a company could have been so important for my life. Despite its difficulties and things that, sometimes, I may not like of it, at the end of the day I am leaving a really great place that completely changed me and made me a better person and professional (I even found my wife :D). I grew and learned so much here. I will always be thankful to this company and to my fantastic colleagues I&rsquo;ve been honored to work with.</p>

<p>I am also thinking about all the things that I started to do here in France. Photography has become my passion and I&rsquo;m so thrilled to think that I&rsquo;m going to live in the city of Nikon and Fujifilm :) I have so many ideas about photography in Japan!
I also started to organize events and I started to overcome my fear of public speaking. I can&rsquo;t wait to start to be an active member in the technical Meetups panorama of Tokyo, and also to organize one (Tokyo Software Craftsmanship? :-)). I started to travel and to know people from all around the world. I learned well French and improved my English. I started to have a fully multicultural life. I changed my point of view on everything and I learned that everything is relative: <em>tout est relatif</em>. I started to be a Global Citizen. I learned what I want to do and I have a clear direction for my future career.</p>

<p>I could write for hours just listing all the things I learned, but I stop here.</p>

<p>I am leaving with a bag of experience, a huge amount of energy and lots of ideas for the future. But most important, I can&rsquo;t wait to start living with my wife, have a <em>normal life</em> with her - if we can say <em>normal</em> in Tokyo - settle down and raise a family together for the first time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p><em>Merci la France</em> for everything you gave me.</p>
